## ❤ Mission Statement
*Pandemic Protection* is a 2D platformer that aims to educate its players about COVID-19 and the precautions that should be taken (in accordance with the Canadian government's guidelines), using these guidelines (most notably, social distancing) as a basis for game mechanics. Development took place from January to April 2021.

Our team wanted to make something that would be impactful and thus started thinking of concepts relevant to our lives. We eventually agreed to focus on the COVID-19 pandemic. The setting being serious, we wanted to ensure we were sensitive to the issue and tasteful in our design choices, so rather than make a game spoofing the pandemic, we decided to make a game that raises awareness about the dangers of not taking precautions. After all, it is partially due to the ignorance of others on such issues that Ontario (and many parts of the world) continue to rise in the number of COVID-19 cases every day, even after many months of dealing with the pandemic. *Pandemic Protection* seeks to help young people understand the consequences of their choices and hopefully help eliminate the ignorance surrounding the COVID-19 virus and pandemic.

As a team, we agreed the most effective way to raise awareness for these precautions, as well as make the game interesting, was to actually base game mechanics on the guidelines. Typically, platform games allow the player to fight any enemies in their way (ex. Mario can stomp on Goombas). In *Pandemic Protection*, the "enemies" are other people out in public, who have a chance of infecting the player. We felt it would be unrealistic and in poor taste to have the player defeat enemies, at least in the traditional sense. The whole point of the game is not to have the player defeat coronavirus, but rather to show the player the importance of taking these guidelines seriously. So rather than have the player fight the "enemies," our team has chosen to approach the platformer genre in a different way and have gameplay revolve around avoiding enemies in the same manner people should be social distancing with others outside their bubbles.

With social distancing being the central game mechanic, we decided it would work best with the platformer genre. We had already decided beforehand that due to time constraints and technical ability that we were going to pursue a game with 2D graphics. With 3D graphics, players could manipulate the three axes of movement to socially distance themselves from the NPCs. With 2D graphics, however, we only have two axes to work with--the players cannot walk beside the NPCs without hitting them. With a platformer, we would be able to create levels with various structures for players to jump onto or off of, making the social distancing mechanic easier to play with, as players can use these platforms to avoid the NPCs as much as possible. So while we wanted our game to be as true to life as possible, we had to take some liberties due to the timeline and the little game development experience our team had as a whole going into the project. Overall, our team is very happy and proud to present *Pandemic Protection* as all members' very first serious attempt at game development. Enjoy!

## 👾 Gameplay
The goal of *Pandemic Protection* is simple: get to your essential service as quick as possible, all while maintaining 2m (or 6ft) between you and members of the public you encounter on your journey. Use the controls and various platforms to navigate through bustling cities in a safe and healthy manner. Your health bar decreases if you make contact with any of the citizens, and your point multiplier is negatively impacted for every second you spend in close proximity to another person. Lose all your health or spend too much time in someone else's space and it's **GAME OVER** (aka, you must quarantine for 14 days).

You'll start off at your lovely home, where you can access the different levels by exiting through the door and picking an errand to do. At home, you may also boot up your computer and access P-Mart to order some helpful powerups with Protection Points, or check out your trophy case to see your high scores for each level. Protection Points can be collected throughout the levels, though are definitely optional! 

And don't worry about saving! The game automatically saves after each level completed. Good luck and stay safe!
